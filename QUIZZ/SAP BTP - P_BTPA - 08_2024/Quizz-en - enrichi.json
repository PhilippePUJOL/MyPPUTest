CAP provides a rich set of libraries, tools, and conventions that streamline development, including CDS (Core Data Services) for data modeling, service definitions, and integration capabilities. One of its key features is built-in support for multi-tenancy, allowing developers to build scalable SaaS applications that serve multiple customers with isolated data and configurations. Incorrect options include the claim that CAP enforces strict MVC patterns—CAP is flexible and does not mandate MVC—and that it is exclusively for ABAP, which is false.
