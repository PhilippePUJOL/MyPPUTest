Geolocation services in SAP BTP can be used to tailor access based on user location, which is particularly useful for enforcing regional data privacy regulations or operational restrictions. Integrating with an on-premise identity system may introduce latency and complexity, especially for global access.

MDG provides governance (validators, workflows, duplicate checks, consolidation/central governance) and a master data model. Data Intelligence adds connectivity, metadata management and pipeline orchestration to bring non‑SAP sources under control without heavy point‑to‑point coding. Integration Suite offers Cloud Integration, API Management and Event Mesh to expose services, transform payloads and push deltas/event notifications at scale.

This approach supports the 'clean core' principle, ensuring that the core system remains stable and upgradeable. Unlike embedded or in-app extensibility, which involve changes within the core system or UI layers, side-by-side extensibility uses services like SAP Extension Suite and Cloud Foundry/Kyma runtimes to host custom applications. This method is ideal for scalable, loosely coupled solutions that require flexibility and innovation without impacting the core ERP.
