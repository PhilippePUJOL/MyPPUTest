            "explanation": "The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) is best suited for scenarios that require rapid development of scalable, enterprise-grade applications on SAP BTP. Correct answers:\n- 'Developing multi-tenant SaaS applications': CAP supports multi-tenancy natively, allowing developers to build SaaS solutions that can serve multiple customers with isolated data and configurations. This is achieved through CAPâ€™s built-in tenant-aware services and deployment models.\n- 'Creating extensions for SAP S/4HANA': CAP is ideal for side-by-side extensions of SAP S/4HANA, enabling developers to build loosely coupled applications that interact with core systems via APIs and events, without modifying the core.\nIncorrect answers:\n- 'Implementing real-time analytics': While CAP can expose data services, it is not optimized for real-time analytics, which typically require specialized tools like SAP HANA or SAP Analytics Cloud.\n- 'Building AI-powered applications': CAP does not provide native AI capabilities. AI scenarios are better handled using SAP AI Core or integrating external AI services.\nðŸ’¡ Memory tip: CAP = Cloud-native + Extensions + Multi-tenancy. Think of CAP as the 'framework for enterprise-grade apps on SAP BTP'.",

It includes features like API products, rate plans, and usage analytics, which are essential for monetization.\n- 'SAP API Business Hub Enterprise': This is the enterprise-grade version of SAPâ€™s API portal, enabling internal and external API exposure, subscription management, and monetization features.\nIncorrect answers:\n- 'SAP Business Accelerator Hub': This is a public-facing catalog of SAP content but does not support monetization features.\n- 'SAP Market Rates Management, Bring Your Own Rates data option': This is a financial service for managing market rates and is unrelated to API monetization.\nðŸ’¡ Memory tip: Monetization = Management + Marketplace.
